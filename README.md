# K-means-Clustering-Mall-customer-
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data into K distinct groups based on similarity. It initializes K centroids, assigns data points to the nearest centroid, and iteratively updates centroids until convergence. K-means is widely used for tasks like market segmentation and image compression.
